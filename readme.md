Because I Received two Questions I created this repository with two folder

Qus1 is the solution for QUS1

Qus2 is the solution for QUS2

In Qus1 folder run, npm i and npm start and it will work automatically

In Qus2 folder

I used MongoDB as database

in the config, folder dev.js use your MongoDB database URI

run npm i and npm run dev

It should work!
